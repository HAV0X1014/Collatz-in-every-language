Zedus Cycle Conjecture
Author: Durga Shankar Akodia

Let N denote the set of natural numbers.

Define the function
f(n) = |n − R(n)| on N,

where R(n) is the number obtained by reversing the decimal digits of n, with leading zeros removed.

Under repeated iteration of the function f, every natural number exhibits one of the following two behaviors:

1. Zero Convergence
Some numbers eventually become 0.
This occurs when a palindrome is reached, since n = R(n) implies f(n) = 0.
Once 0 is reached, the process terminates.

2. Zedus Cycle Loop
Some numbers never reach 0.
Instead, they enter a finite non-zero cycle:
n₁ → n₂ → … → nₖ → n₁
This repeating loop is called a Zedus Cycle Loop.

Additional Principle (Cycle Classification)

The Zedus Cycle Conjecture further asserts that Zedus Cycle Loops occur in different classes based on digit length, digit structure, and numerical categories.
Across these different classes, there exist infinitely many distinct Zedus Cycle Loops.

Thus, under the Zedus Cycle Conjecture, every natural number either:
• converges to 0, or
• becomes trapped in a Zedus Cycle Loop.
